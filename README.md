---------------------------------

### 1. Rude_GPT
This version of AI Chatbot helps understand the importance of the prompt passed to the llm. It is built using langchain, OpenAIAPI, Streamlit. It gives rude responses to all the queries and is quite aggressive, it is kinda funny tbhðŸ™‚, check it out for yourself. 

### 2. Handling-chains
In this code we build and understand the working of chains in langchain, instead of simply using the Sequential chain, we handle the output of each chain manually to understand the processs going on inside chains like SimpleSequentailChain and SequentialChain.

Uses chains from langchain, OpenAIAPI, streamlit

### 3. RAG
Building a streamlit app implementing a RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) system using Langchain. We read a pdf "attention.pdf" from our directory, make the embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings, store them in the FAISS database, and instead of using a simple retrival_chain we do handle the output ourselves for better understanding of the variables, outputs and logic involved

### 4. Groq
Groq's Inferencing engine is the best in the market by a long shot and free available access to inference using provided opensource models means you gotta check it out.

The code implements a RAG system (yes againðŸ™‚), the embeddings and DB are present in session_state so they don't have to reload everytime we run script. and we don't handle the output of chains manually this time, instead we use the stuff_doc_chain and the retrival_chain, streamling the process of getting the output.

Make sure to get the Groq API Access from here :

### 5. Structured_Tools
Structured tools help keep code more organised, readable, and extendable. In this code I implemented a structured tool that provides a comprehensive Topic report on a given topic, uses newsapi for getting the news, ChatOpenAI for getting facts about the topic, and Textblob for easily analysing the sentiment of the topic based on description of articles provided by the news api. If you're using this.
1. Install textblob to the pre-existing requirements.txt
2. get the news_api key from ' https://newsapi.org/ '
and set them in the code

### 6. HuggingFace Inferencing
This code contains implementation of a streamlit app that takes queries and provides answers using the huggingface opensource model, and also uses hugging face inferencing, since the model isn't downloaded on the system, we just send queries to HF using the requests library.(PS - Don't forget to set the HF_API_KEY in the requirements.txt ðŸ™‚)
